***Credit to Stathead / Baseball-Reference for information on the statistical terms/variables***

Tm - a franchise's abbreviation; this will be excluded from the analysis as team name is irrelevant to performance	

Lg – which league a team is in (AL, NL, or Both)
  -AL = American League
  -NL = National League
  -Both >> the Houston Astros switched from the NL to the AL before the 2013 MLB season
  
MarketSize2012 – how big a team’s market is (Small, Medium, or Big) 
  -Based on Bleacher Report's article discussed in my first Progress Report
  
Salary – compares how much money a team spent on its players compared to the league average

tmW%L – a team’s win-loss percentage
  -Calculation: total # of wins / total # of games played

TB/G – total bases per game
  -Total bases calculation: Singles + (2 * Doubles) + (3 * Triples) + (4 * Home Runs)
    -Calculation: team's total bases / total # of games played

RC/G – runs created per game
  -Runs Created estimates a player's total contributions to a team's runs total
    -A technical calculation/formula developed by Bill James and others.
  -Calculation: runs created per 27 outs used

BAbip – batting average on balls in play
  -Calculation: (hits - homeruns) / (at-bats - strikeouts - homeruns - sacrifice flies)

BA – batting average
  -Calculation: hits / at-bats

OBP – on base percentage
  -Calculation: (hits + base-on-balls + hit-by-pitch) / (at-bats + base-on-balls + hit-by-pitch + sacrifice flies)

SLG – slugging percentage
  -Calculation: total bases / at-bats

OPS – on base percentage plus slugging percentage
  -Calculation: OBP + SLG

OPS+ - OPS as a normalized number across the whole league; considers factors like ballparks
  -Calculation: 100 * [(OBP / league average OBP) + (SLG / (league average - 1))]

*hWAR – the total Wins Above Replacement values of every position player on a team

RA9 – the number of runs against a team per nine innings
  -Calculation: runs given up by a team * 9  / innings pitched
    -Runs are both unearned and earned in this case; 9 stands for the nine innings in a standard baseball game

*pWAR - the total Wins Above Replacement values of every pitcher on a team

ERA+ - Earned Run Average (ERA) as a normalized number across the whole league; considers factors like ballparks
  -Calculation: 100 * (league average ERA / ERA)
    -ERA is calculated by: (9 * earned runs) / innings pitched

*WAR is a very complicated stat to represent the number of wins a player added to a team above what a replacement player would add.
